# startpage
A simple, work in progress startpage with weather, a clock, some apps and a duckduckgo search bar.

Apps can be customized in apps/default. You can also add different sets of apps in apps/[category] that can be accessed with parameter ?type=[category].
To get the weather to work, type your openweather api key in weather/weather.js. Geolocation should locate your position, but if not (for me it just errors with error code 2), type your coords in the url as ?coords=[lat, long].

Most of the code is by me, but some animations are by https://animate.style/, fonts are from google fonts and some of the clock code is taken from https://codepen.io/eehayman/pen/jVPKpN

This is a work a progress and the code is kind of messy but I hope you like it.
